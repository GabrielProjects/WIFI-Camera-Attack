## Quick Start Guide
1. First of all you'll need to have the rockyou.txt file in the directory where the python file is. <br> You can find the file by going <a href="https://github.com/praetorian-inc/Hob0Rules/blob/master/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz">here</a>.

2. We need to make sure to have the subprocess packet installed, if you need to install it, just run the command: <br>``pip install subprocess``

3. If you are willing to change the wordlist, just change the code in line 17 and 20 as the comments state.

4. When you are willing to start the attack, just run the command:  <br>``python3 PasswordCracker.py``
